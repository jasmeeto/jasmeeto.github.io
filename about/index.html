              Hi! My name is Jasmeet Oberai, and I am a 3rd year Software Engineering student currently studying at the University of Waterloo. I'm passionate about creating. Whether it be through software, or music, or even any other art, I try to push my thoughts and creativity as far they can go.

              I'm a huge advocate of agile development. Whether it be test driven development (TDD) or code review, I like finding the bugs just as much as I like squashing them. I also have a great fascination with puzzles and problem-solving. Finding the solution to a complex software problem, to me, is like intense detective work. I find much enjoyment in the piecing together the clues to get to a final outcome.

             That being said, I'm not a total bore that just codes all day. Music is one of my other big passions. I enjoy music in any shape or form whether it be rap, rock, or country. But most of all, I enjoy Indian classical music. I play the instrument known as a Tabla which is an Indian drum that is played with the hands.

              When I'm not found coding or playing tabla, I can be found playing basketball, soccer and even cricket on the odd occasion.
